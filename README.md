# mathnotepad

A very simple website for writing and rendering LaTeX math expressions (via MathLive) on an infinite canvas. Made quickly (it shows) as a personal tool so I have somewhere to chuck random equations. Might add more stuff if I feel like it.

## Controls

- Right mouse button - add expression
- Left mouse button - move around canvas
- Ctrl+Left mouse button - When used on an expression allows it to be moved
- Scroll wheel - zoom in and out of canvas

## To-Do

- Integrate a basic computer algebra system (CAS)
- Exporting and loading equations
- Switch to a proper UI framework
